          This app was created by volunteers from the
          <a href="http://lwvbae.org/" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_system'); return false;">League of Women Voters Berkeley-Albany-Emeryville</a>.
          Our goal is to make registering to vote as easy as possible for
          everyone.

          It also uses the
          <a href="https://github.com/trustthevote/Rocky" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_system'); return false;">Rock the Vote API</a>
          to generate voter registration form pdfs.
