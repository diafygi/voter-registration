# LWVBAE Voter Registration App

**WARNING: THIS APP IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND DOES NOT WORK YET!**

Demo (doesn't work yet): https://diafygi.github.io/voter-registration/

This project is a mobile application that lets people register
to vote in California. It is made by volunteers for the League
of Women Voters, Berkeley Albany Emeryville chapter.

###How this app works.

There are two ways to use this app to register to vote in
California:

1. If you have a California Drivers License or state ID *that
has your current address*, you can register to vote online!
This app will link you to the online voter registration form at
(http://registertovote.ca.gov/)[http://registertovote.ca.gov/].

2. If you don't have one of the IDs above or your address on
your ID doesn't match your current address, **that's okay**, you
can still register to vote without getting a new ID! This app
will let you submit a request to your local Registrar of Voters
to have a registration form be mailed to you for free. It will
arrive in a few weeks. All you have to do is fill it out and
mail it back in.

###Why did we do this?

Our goal is to get as many people to vote as possible, and the
first step is to get people to register to vote. This app aims
to make voter registration accessible everywhere, including the
app store! Voter Registration? There's an app for that!
